Exercise: Adding science to the reaction system
-----------------------------------------------

We're going to add all the rest of the methods we need to use the reaction system as a set of ordinary differential equations.

Add a method which when called:

* Resets the rate of change of each species to zero.
* Asks each reaction to contribute to the rate of change of all it's participating species.

Add a method which when called return a vector of the rates of change of all species, and another which returns a vector of the concentrations of all species.

Add another method which when called with a container of concentrations, sets the concentration of each species.

Each of these methods should have good tests.

Our solution is v2.2
