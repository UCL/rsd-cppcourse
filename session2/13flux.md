Exercise: Calculating the flux
==============================

Calculating the flux
--------------------

So, the time has come to write a new method, with implementation and tests, which calculates the rate of a reaction, by multiplying the rate constant
by the product of each reactant's concentration.

You will need to iterate over all the reactants, with an appropriate iterator.

Don't forget to write a new test in ReactionTest.cpp

Our solution is tagged as `v1.7`
